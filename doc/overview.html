This chapter presents a high level overview of the GeekOS kernel and
the subsystems you will use when you add new functionality to GeekOS.
Once you have read this chapter, you can refer to <a href="apiref.html" title="Chapter 12. GeekOS API Reference">Chapter 12, <i>GeekOS API Reference</i></a>
for detailed descriptions of functions in the GeekOS kernel.
</p><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="memory"></a>1. Memory</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
The GeekOS kernel manages all memory in the system.  Two types of memory
can be allocated.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="pageallocator"></a>1.1. Page Allocator</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
All of the memory in the system is divided into chunks called <span class="emphasis"><em>pages</em></span>.
In the x86 architecture, the page size is 4K.  A page is a unit of memory
that can be part of a virtual address space; this characteristic of
pages will come into play when you add virtual memory to GeekOS
(<a href="vmproject.html" title="Chapter 9. Project 4: Virtual Memory">Chapter 9, <i>Project 4: Virtual Memory</i></a>).  For now, you can just think of pages
as small fixed size chunks of memory.  Pages are allocated and freed using the
<tt class="literal">Alloc_Page()</tt> and <tt class="literal">Free_Page()</tt>
functions in the <tt class="filename">&lt;geekos/mem.h&gt;</tt> header file.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="heapallocator"></a>1.2. Heap Allocator</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
The heap allocator provides allocation of arbitrary-sized chunks of memory.
The <tt class="literal">Malloc()</tt> function allocates a chunk of memory,
and the <tt class="literal">Free()</tt> function releases a chunk of memory.
The prototypes for these functions are in the <tt class="filename">&lt;geekos/malloc.h&gt;</tt>
header file.
</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="intsandthreads"></a>2. Interrupts and Threads</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Interrupts</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>threads</em></span> are the
mechanisms used by GeekOS to divide CPU resources between the various tasks
the operating system performs.  Understanding how interrupts and
threads interact is crucial to being able to add new functionality to
the kernel.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="interrupts"></a>2.1. Interrupts</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Interrupts</em></span> are used to inform the CPU of the
occurrence of an important event.  The important characteristic
of an interrupt is that it causes control to transfer immediately
to an <span class="emphasis"><em>interrupt handler</em></span>. Interrupt handlers are
simply C functions.
</p><p>
There are several kinds of interrupts:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Exceptions</em></span> indicate that the currently executing
      thread performed an illegal action. They are a form of <span class="emphasis"><em>synchronous</em></span>
      interrupt, because they happen in a predictable manner.  Examples include execution of
      an invalid instruction and attempts to divide by zero.  Exceptions
      generally kill the thread which raised them, because there is no way
      to recover from the exception.
    </p></li><li><p>
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Faults</em></span>, like exceptions, are also synchronous. Unlike
      exceptions, they are generally recoverable; the kernel can do some work
      to remove the condition that caused the fault, and then allow the faulting
      thread to continue executing.  An example is a <span class="emphasis"><em>page fault</em></span>,
      which indicates that a page containing a referenced memory location is
      not currently mapped into the address space.  If the kernel can locate the
      page and map it back into the address space, the faulting thread can continue
      executing.  You will learn more about page faults in <a href="vmproject.html" title="Chapter 9. Project 4: Virtual Memory">Chapter 9, <i>Project 4: Virtual Memory</i></a>.
    </p></li><li><p>
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Hardware interrupts</em></span> are used by external hardware
      devices to notify the CPU of an event.  These interrupts are
      <span class="emphasis"><em>asynchronous</em></span>, because they are unpredictable.
      In other words, an asynchronous interrupt can happen at any time.
      Sometimes the kernel is in a state where it cannot immediately handle
      an asynchronous interrupts.  In this case, the kernel can temporarily
      <span class="emphasis"><em>disable interrupts</em></span> until it is ready to handle
      them again.  An example of a hardware interrupt is the
      <span class="emphasis"><em>timer interrupt</em></span>.
    </p></li><li><p>
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Software interrupts</em></span> are used by <span class="emphasis"><em>user mode</em></span>
      processes to signal that they require attention from the kernel.  The
      only kind of software interrupt used in GeekOS is the
      <span class="emphasis"><em>system call interrupt</em></span>, which is used by processes
      to request a service from the kernel.  For example, system calls are
      used by processes to open files, perform input and output, spawn new processes,
      etc.
    </p></li></ul></div><p>
</p><p>
When an interrupt handler has completed, it returns control to the
thead which was interrupted at the exact instruction where the interrupt
occurred.  For the most part, the original thread
resumes as if the interrupt never happened.
</p><p>
The occurrence of an interrupt can cause a <span class="emphasis"><em>thread context switch</em></span>.
This fact has imporant consequences for code that modifies shared
kernel data structures, and will be described in detail in
<a href="overview.html#interactions" title="2.4. Interactions between Interrupts and Threads">Section 2.4, &#8220;Interactions between Interrupts and Threads&#8221;</a>.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="threads"></a>2.2. Threads</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
Threads allow multiple tasks to share the CPU.  In GeekOS, each thread
is represented by a <tt class="literal">Kernel_Thread</tt> object,
defined in <tt class="filename">&lt;geekos/kthread.h&gt;</tt>.
</p><p>
Threads are selected for execution by the <span class="emphasis"><em>scheduler</em></span>.
At any given time, a single thread is executing.  This is the
<span class="emphasis"><em>current thread</em></span>, and a pointer to its <tt class="literal">Kernel_Thread</tt>
object is available in the <tt class="literal">g_currentThread</tt> global variable.
Threads that are ready to run, but not currently running, are placed
in the <span class="emphasis"><em>run queue</em></span>.  Threads that are waiting for
a specific event to occur are placed on a <span class="emphasis"><em>wait queue</em></span>.
Both the run queue and wait queues are instances of the
<tt class="literal">Thread_Queue</tt> data structure, which is simply a linked
list of <tt class="literal">Kernel_Thread</tt> objects.
</p><p>
Some threads execute entirely in kernel mode.  These threads are called
<span class="emphasis"><em>system threads</em></span>.  System threads are used to perform
demand-driven tasks within the kernel.  For example, a system thread called
the <span class="emphasis"><em>reaper thread</em></span> is used to free the resources of
threads which have exited.  The floppy and IDE disk drives each use a
system thread to wait for I/O requests, perform them, and communicate
the results back to the requesting threads.
</p><p>
In contrast to system threads, <span class="emphasis"><em>processes</em></span> spend most of their
time executing in <span class="emphasis"><em>user mode</em></span>.  Processes should be
familiar to you already; when you run an ordinary program in an operating
system like Linux or Windows, the system creates a process to execute
the program.  Each process consists of a <span class="emphasis"><em>memory space</em></span>
reserved for the exclusive use of the running program, as well as other
resources like files and semaphores.
</p><p>
In GeekOS, a process is simply a <tt class="literal">Kernel_Thread</tt> which has
a special data structure attached to it.  This data structure is the
<tt class="literal">User_Context</tt>.  It contains all of the memory and other
resources allocated to the process.  Because processes are just ordinary
threads which have the capability of executing in user mode, they are
sometimes referred to in GeekOS as <span class="emphasis"><em>user threads</em></span>.
</p><p>
Processes start out executing in user mode.  However, interrupts
occurring while the process is executing in user mode cause the
process to switch back into kernel mode.  When the interrupt handler
returns, the process resumes executing in user mode.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="threadsync"></a>2.3. Thread Synchronization</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
GeekOS provides a high level mechanism to synchronize threads:
<span class="emphasis"><em>mutexes</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>condition variables</em></span>.
(The mutex and condition variable implementation in GeekOS is modeled
on the pthreads API, so if you have some any pthreads programming,
this section should seem very familiar.)  Mutexes and condition
variables are defined in the <tt class="filename">&lt;geekos/synch.h&gt;</tt>
header file.

</p><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Important"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Important]" src="figures/important.png"></td><th align="left">Important</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p>
    Mutexes and condition variables may only be used to synchronize threads.
    It is not legal to access a mutex or condition variable from an
    handler for an asynchronous interrupt.
  </p></td></tr></table></div><p>
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Mutexes</em></span> are used to guard <span class="emphasis"><em>critical sections</em></span>.
A mutex ensures MUTual EXclusion within a critical section guarded by the
mutex; only one thread is allowed to hold a mutex at any given time.
If a thread tries to acquire a mutex that is already held by another
thread, it is suspended until the mutex is available.
</p><p>
Here is an example of a function that atomically adds a node to a list:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
#include &lt;geekos/synch.h&gt;

struct Mutex lock;
struct Node_List nodeList;

void Add_Node(struct Node *node) {
    Mutex_Lock(&amp;lock);
    Add_To_Back_Of_Node_List(&amp;nodeList, node);
    Mutex_Unlock(&amp;lock);
}
</pre><p>
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Condition variables</em></span> represent a condition that threads
can wait for.  Each condition variable is associated with a mutex,
which must be held while accessing the condition variable and when inspecting
or modifying the program state associated with the condition.
</p><p>
Here is an elaboration of the earlier example that allows threads
to wait for a node to become available in the node list:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
#include &lt;geekos/synch.h&gt;

struct Mutex lock;
struct Condition nodeAvail;
struct Node_List nodeList;

void Add_Node(struct Node *node) {
    Mutex_Lock(&amp;lock);
    Add_To_Back_Of_Node_List(&amp;nodeList, node);
    Cond_Broadcast(&amp;nodeAvail);
    Mutex_Unlock(&amp;lock);
}

struct Node *Wait_For_Node(void) {
    struct Node *node;

    Mutex_Lock(&amp;lock);
    while (Is_Node_List_Empty(&amp;nodeList)) {
        /* Wait for another thread to call Add_Node() */
        Cond_Wait(&amp;nodeAvail, &amp;lock);
    }
    node = Remove_From_Front_Of_Node_List(&amp;nodeList);
    Mutex_Unlock(&amp;lock);

    return node;
}
</pre><p>

The GeekOS kernel is <span class="emphasis"><em>preemptible</em></span>.  This means that,
in general, a <span class="emphasis"><em>thread context switch</em></span> can occur at any time.
Choosing which thread to execute at a preemption point is the job
of the <span class="emphasis"><em>scheduler</em></span>.  In general, the scheduler will
choose the task which has the highest <span class="emphasis"><em>priority</em></span>
and is ready to execute.
</p><p>
The main cause of asynchronous (involuntary) threads switches is the
timer interrupts, which the kernel uses to ensure that no single
thread can completely monopolize the CPU.  However, other hardware interrupts
(such as the floppy disk interrupt) can also cause asynchronous thread switches.
Threads often need to modify data structures shared by other threads
and/or interrupt handler functions.  If a thread switch were to occur
in the middle of an operation modifying a shared data structure, the data
structure could be left in an inconsistent state, leading to a
kernel crash or other unpredictable behavior.
</p><p>
Fortunately, it is easy to temporarily disable preemption by
<span class="emphasis"><em>disabling interrupts</em></span>.  This is done by calling
the <tt class="literal">Disable_Interrupts()</tt> function
(prototype in <tt class="filename">&lt;geekos/int.h&gt;</tt>).
After this function is called, the processor ignores
all external hardware interrupts.  While interrupts are disabled,
the current thread is guaranteed to retain control of the CPU:
no other threads or interrupt handlers will execute.
When the thread is ready to re-enable preemption, it can call
<tt class="literal">Enable_Interrupts()</tt>.
</p><p>
There are a variety of situations when interrupts should be disabled.
Generally, disabling interrupts can be used to make any sequence
of instructions <span class="emphasis"><em>atomic</em></span>; this means that the
entire sequence of instructions is guaranteed to complete as a unit,
without interruption.
</p><p>
The most important specific situation when interrupts should be disabled
is when a scheduler data structure is modified.  A typical example is
putting the current thread on a <span class="emphasis"><em>wait queue</em></span>.  Here is an
example:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
/* Wait for an event */
Disable_Interrupts();
while (!eventHasOccurred) {
    Wait(&amp;waitQueue);
}
Enable_Interrupts();
</pre><p>
In this example, a thread is waiting for the occurrence of an asynchronous
event.  Until the event occurs, it will suspend itself by waiting on
a wait queue.  When the event occurs, the interrupt handler for the event
will set the <tt class="literal">eventHasOccurred</tt> flag and move the
thread from the wait queue to the run queue.
</p><p>
Consider what could happen if interrupts were <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
disabled in the example above.  First, the interrupt handler for the event
could occur between the time <tt class="literal">eventHasOccurred</tt> is checked
and when the calling thread puts itself on the wait queue.  This might
result in the thread waiting forever, even though the event it is waiting
for has already occurred.  A second possibility is that a thread switch
might occur while the thread is adding itself to the wait queue.
The handler for the interrupt causing the thread switch will place the
current thread on the run queue, <span class="emphasis"><em>while the wait queue is in 
a modified (inconsistent) state</em></span>.  Any code accessing the
wait queue (such as an interrupt handler or another thread)
might cause the system to crash.
</p><p>
Fortunately, (almost) all functions in GeekOS that need to be called with
interrupts disabled contain an assertion that will inform you immediately
if they are called with interupts enabled.  You will see many
places in the code that look like this:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
KASSERT(!Interrupts_Enabled());
</pre><p>
These statements indicate that interrupts must be disabled in order
for the code immediately following to execute.
Knowing when interrupts need to be disabled is a bit tricky
at first, but you will soon get the hang of it.
</p><p>
One final caveat: regions of code which explicitly disable interrupts
cannot be nested.  Another way to put this is that it is illegal to
call <tt class="literal">Disable_Interrupts()</tt> when interrupts are
already disabled, and it is illegal to call <tt class="literal">Enabled_Interrupts()</tt>
when interrupts are already enabled.  Consider the following code:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
void f(void) {
    Disable_Interrupts();
    g();
    ... modify shared data structures ...
    Enable_Interrupts();
}

void g(void) {
    Disable_Interrupts();
    ...
    Enable_Interrupts();
}
</pre><p>
This code, if allowed to execute, would contain a bug.  If the function
<tt class="literal">g()</tt> returned with interrupts enabled, a context switch
in function <tt class="literal">f()</tt> could interrupt a modification to
a shared data structure, leaving it in an inconsistent state.
Fortunately, there is a simple way to write code that will selectively
disable interrupts if needed:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
bool iflag;

iflag = Begin_Int_Atomic();
... interrupts are disabled ...
End_Int_Atomic(iflag);
</pre><p>
Sections of code that use <tt class="literal">Begin_Int_Atomic()</tt> and
<tt class="literal">End_Int_Atomic()</tt> may be nested safely.
</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="devices"></a>3. Devices</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
The GeekOS kernel contains <span class="emphasis"><em>device drivers</em></span> for
several important hardware devices.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="screen"></a>3.1. Text Screen</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
The text screen provides support for displaying text.  The screen
driver in GeekOS emulates a subset of VT100 and ANSI escape codes
for cursor movement and setting character attributes.  Text screen
services are provided in the <tt class="filename">&lt;geekos/screen.h&gt;</tt>
header file.
</p><p>
The main function you will use in sending output to the screen is
the <tt class="literal">Print()</tt> function, which supports a subset of the
functionality of the standard C <tt class="literal">printf()</tt> function.
Low level screen output is provided by the <tt class="literal">Put_Char()</tt>
and <tt class="literal">Put_Buf()</tt> functions, which write a single character
and a sequence of characters to the screen, respectively.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="keyboard"></a>3.2. Keyboard</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
The keyboard device driver provides a high level interface to the
keyboard.  It installs an interrupt handler for keyboard events,
and translates the low level key scan codes to higher level codes
that contain ASCII character codes for pressed keys, as well as
modifier information (whether shift, control, and/or alt are pressed).
The header for for the keyboard services is <tt class="filename">&lt;geekos/keyboard.h&gt;</tt>.
</p><p>
Threads can wait for a key event by calling the <tt class="literal">Wait_For_Key()</tt>
function.  Key codes are returned using the <tt class="literal">Keycode</tt> datatype,
which is a 16 bit unsigned integer.  The low 10 bits of the keycode indicate
which physical key was pressed or released.  Several flag bits are used:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
      <tt class="literal">KEY_SPECIAL_FLAG</tt> is set for keys that do not
      have an ASCII representation.  For examples, function keys and
      cursor keys call into this category.  If this flag is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
      set, then the low 8 bits of the key code contain the ASCII code.
    </p></li><li><p>
      <tt class="literal">KEY_KEYPAD_FLAG</tt> is set for keys on the numeric keypad.
    </p></li><li><p>
      <tt class="literal">KEY_SHIFT_FLAG</tt> is set if one of the shift keys is
      currently pressed.  For alphabetic keys, this will cause the ASCII code
      to be upper case.
    </p></li><li><p>
      <tt class="literal">KEY_CTRL_FLAG</tt> and <tt class="literal">KEY_ALT_FLAG</tt>
      are set to indicate that the control and alt keys are pressed,
      respectively.
    </p></li><li><p>
      <tt class="literal">KEY_RELEASE_FLAG</tt> is set for key release events.
      You will probably want to ignore key events that have this flag set.
    </p></li></ul></div><p>
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="timer"></a>3.3. System Timer</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
The system timer is used to provide a periodic timeslice interrupt.
After the current thread has been interrupted a set number of times
by the timer interrupt, the scheduler is invoked to choose a new thread.
You will generally not need to use any timer services directly.
However, it is worth noting that the system timer is the mechanism used
to ensure that all threads have a chance to execute by preventing any
single thread from monopolizing the CPU.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="blockdevs"></a>3.4. Block Devices: Floppy and IDE Disks</h3></div></div><div></div></div></div><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Block devices</em></span> are the abstraction used to represent
storage devices: i.e., disks.  They are called block devices because they
are organized as a sequence of fixed size blocks called <span class="emphasis"><em>sectors</em></span>.
Block device services are defined in the <tt class="filename">&lt;geekos/blockdev.h&gt;</tt>
header file.
</p><p>
Although real block devices often have varying sector sizes, GeekOS makes
the simplifying assumption that all block devices have a fixed sector size
of 512 bytes.  This is the value defined by the <tt class="literal">SECTOR_SIZE</tt>
macro.
</p><p>
GeekOS supports two kinds of block devices: <span class="emphasis"><em>floppy drives</em></span>
and <span class="emphasis"><em>IDE disk drives</em></span>.  A naming scheme is used to 
identify particular drives attached to the system:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><tt class="literal">fd0</tt>: the first floppy drive</p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">ide0</tt>: the first IDE disk drive</p></li><li><p><tt class="literal">ide1</tt>: the second IDE disk drive</p></li></ul></div><p>
A particular instance of a block device is represented in the kernel by
the <tt class="literal">Block_Device</tt> data structure.  You can retrieve a
block device object by passing its name to the <tt class="literal">Open_Block_Device()</tt>
function.  Once you have the block device object, you can read and write
particular sectors using the <tt class="literal">Block_Read()</tt> and
<tt class="literal">Block_Write()</tt> functions.
</p><p>
Block devices are used as the underlying storage for <span class="emphasis"><em>filesystems</em></span>.
A filesystem builds higher level abstractions (files and directories)
on top of the raw block storage offered by block devices.  In
<a href="fsproject.html" title="Chapter 10. Project 5: A Filesystem">Chapter 10, <i>Project 5: A Filesystem</i></a>, you will implement a filesystem using
an underlying block device.
